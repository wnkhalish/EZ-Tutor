        <p style="color:white; font-size:20px;"><b>Nature of a Code of Ethics</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li style="color:white; font-size:15px;">When you join a profession or an organization, it's important to review the code of ethics.
            A well-written code defines morals, personal qualities, rules and behaviors that everyone must
            follow. In some states such as Florida, a code of ethics is written into the law.
            Violations of a government-defined code of ethics might be enforced by a regulatory agency or
            the courts. An example is a state code of ethics for administrators in the public K-12 school
            system.</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="color:white; font-size:20px;"><b>Scope</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li style="color:white; font-size:15px;">A code of ethics places your job in context, such as what clients you
            serve in the scope of your duties. For example, a school principal serves students, teachers
            and parents, but she also serves the public as a steward of public funds. Look to a code of
            ethics to point out your most important clients, such as schoolchildren and their best
            interests, and how you must balance their needs with others' needs</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="color:white; font-size:20px;"><b>Administrator Values</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li style="color:white; font-size:15px;">Membership in a profession or organization means you must support the
            values in the code of ethics. If you act in ways that don't reflect those values,
            you risk losing your job. To work as a manager for the Coca-Cola Company, a manager must
            adhere to a code of business conduct, which rests upon the idea of integrity or doing what
            is right. When working in a private business, your values must not only follow the code.
            Your values must support the company brand. Otherwise, what you represent is bad for business.</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="color:white; font-size:20px;"><b>Administrator Behaviors</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li style="color:white; font-size:15px;">As an administrator, you must use good judgment. Adapt your behavior
            to each situation, but expect that conflicts will arise between different expectations in the
            code of ethics. These are gray areas that require you to make a judgment call. Other
            expectations for administrative behavior are clear. You shouldn't misrepresent your
            qualifications or misrepresent facts when communicating with anyone during business activities.
            Overall, your behaviors must set you apart as an example for others. Most importantly, your actions
            must show that you believe in a code of ethics and are a true representative of your profession.</li>
